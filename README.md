# UFOs2

##Overview of Project

Dana has asked for assistance in making sure that her webpage and dynamic table information is working at an optimal level and to summarize the analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The actual data found on UFO encounters is held in JavaScript files which are best used for HTML files in how you can easily refer to specific lines of code to make the webpage interactive. We helped create a search tool using these HTML tags along with the descriptive JavaScript code that allows users to plug in various search options in order to review the accompanying UFO encounter information. The goal of the exercise was to provide a user-friendly experience for site visitors in there searches for extraterrestrial life. 

##Search Results

When a visitor goes to the webpage to search for UFO encounters they will be greeted with a grand title, an expose piece asking the age old question, “Are we alone in the universe?” and a search tool which will allow visitors to investigate UFO encounters events in different states, different time periods, and a summary of what happened during the captured event. 

##Summary

The exercise to help Dana create an interactive webpage utilizing JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to search for UFO encounters was a productive training in understanding how webpages are built and how to enhance their visual appeal. The search box tool was limited in its inputs though and only relayed very specific information and lacked greater detail. It was also case sensitive, so if a visitor had all CAPS in then their search it would not return any results. Altering the JavaScript code to implement these recommendations would continue to build upon the enhancement of the webpage. In conclusion, the challenge exercise was a great start for an interactive webpage, but further edits would continue to improve the site and boost visitor traffic.
